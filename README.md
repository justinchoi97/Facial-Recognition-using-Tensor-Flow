# Facial-Recognition-using-Tensor-Flow
Facial Recognition  Access management Using Tensorflow framework

# 26/6/18
This is a new project I will be undertaking as a 'personal holiday project'. The idea of using facial recognition as a access management system stem from my previous project 'CloudLock', which allows user access to the door from a smartphone. The approach is that I would like to integrate the system with the facial detection algorithm. Upon opening the application of the user's smartphone, the user will be introduced with the facial detection stage: if the user's face matches with the registered facial recognition dataset, the access to the door will be granted and the electric strike will be unlocked. I am also considering getting a raspberry Pi to run as a MCU, which will also give me exposure to Linux environment and Raspberian Pi OS.

This will be a great way to get hands-on ML TensorFlow framework and Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition.

I expect to complete the project before the end of uni holiday and my progress will be updated here throughout the time-frame.
